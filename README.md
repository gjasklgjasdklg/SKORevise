# SKORevise
School Subject Knowledge Organiser revision programs. You can use these for personal use if you want, to help you learn something new or revise something you already know. Currently only has a program for revising Computer Science, but I might add more. 

# Usage
You can download the entire repo, or individual programs (when there are more than one of those, working on that) 

Then run with:

```python <program_name>.py```

Then follow the instructions that the program gives you.
